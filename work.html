            <div class="push-r">
              <p>Users need a personal assistant in the kitchen due to their busy and hectic schedules. They don’t have time to deal with small repetitive tasks.</p>
              <p>Fridgeory allows the users to keep track of their food that’s in the fridge. The app will notify users when a food item is about to expire or running low. Fridgeory will then reorder the food through an online grocery store of their choice.</p>
              <p>Users can also look up recipes based on the ingredients in their fridge.</p>

        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Fridgeory’s ability to monitor food and inform you when you are running low saves users from having to do this themselves. Having the app order their groceries for them will help these personas save time in their busy schedule. When they want something quick and easy they can go into the recipes section of the app and find recipes ideas with ingredients already in their fridge. This app’s soul purpose is to help the user free up time in their busy schedule.</p>

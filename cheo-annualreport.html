          <p>The concept for this annual report was to keep it very graphic based. I wanted the report to be easy to understand and what been way to do that then infographics. Having a heavily graphic look supports the informative look of the report.</p>

          <div class="long-version unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 gutter pad-b">
            <h3 class="giga push-0 normal">Style</h3>
            <p>The style of this report is graphic and science based. The science elements were important as it reflects the company and their work in a science based industry. Consistent circle pattern that resemble cells were used as a recurring pattern throughout report. Each section has graphic elements that explain the information on the page. The colours are bright and bold. This gives the booklet a positive and uplifting feel and reflects the good work the research institute does.</p>
